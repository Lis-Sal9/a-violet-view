            "content": "{i}Compulsory Heterosexuality and Lesbian Existence{/i} (1980), essay written by Adrienne Rich, establishes the obligatory heterosexuality as a capitalist mechanism to impose the women economic subordination to men in marriage and maternity. Patriarchal exploitation and abuse has caused, as she wrote, women to internalize the idea that they are sexual objects and to accept the breach of their limits by men in order to survive. This way, she proposes a woman who identifies as so and who loves other women as well, which she calls {i}continuous lesbianism{/i}."

            "content": "Aleksandra Kollontay was an advocate for a structured and more fair society where the State supports the women, especially working mothers, and those had the same political and legal rights than of the men. In 1909 she wrote {i}The Social Basis of the Woman Question{/i}, a work in which she proposes measures like State economic aid to pregnant and lactating women, socialization of domestic works and child care, which she considered it was a social responsibly and not individual, so this allowed women to contribute both politically and economically to the State."

            "name": "Alicia Walker",
            "content": "According to Alicia Walker, feminism dominated by middle class white women ignores racism while contributing to it. Black women, besides gender inequality, suffer racial inequality and so they are more oppressed. Because of this, she establishes that they require a proper feminism, called {i}womanism{/i} (1983), that takes into account gender, racial and class oppression. This way, {i}womanism{/i} aims to fight for the life of black women and to contribute to the ways they survive to their multiple oppressions. With this spectrum of actions, she emphasizes in the {i}womanish{/i}, in those who question themselves, in love to other women and beings and in self-healing through love to spirituality, dance and music. So, {i}womanism{/i} places a bid for the renounce of class divisions, the promotion of gender equality, the sexuality freedom and refusal of racism."

            "content": "In 1981 was published {i}Women, Race and Class{/i}, by Angela Davis. This essay prompts that feminism is full of prejudices on race and gender. At the same time, she also states how the slavery subdued black women with inhuman manners that reflected very different assumptions about feminity, race and gender. This way, she exposes the reasons why black women's vindications were systematically made invisible even with their hidden revolutionary potential. Besides making manifest the fighting strategies of black women, she also exposes the composition troubles of the differences that nowadays still rip apart the political movements."

            "name": "Anne Koedt",
            "content": "Men called {i}frigid{/i} to the women who could not have vaginal orgasms. This is so much that women were sexually defined by whatever pleases men, in other words, sexuality is politics. Anne Koedt, author of {i}The Myth of the Vaginal Orgasm{/i} (1968), exposes that vaginal stimulation is not enough by itself because it doesn't stimulates the clitoris; therefore, there is no orgasm. The fact that men call {i}frigid{/i} to the women blames them. This way, men keep the myth of the vaginal orgasm because of their own predominant desire of penetration and, at the same time, by fear to be expendable."

The main problem is a political one, because the concept of woman equals to mother and wife, which cuts down every chance of personal fulfillment and blames all those who are not happy living only for the others. This unhappy feeling of the women is called {i}the problem with no name{/i}. The idealized picture of feminity rooted in marriage and family was still present among women, which the autor mentioned in her book {i}The Feminine Mystique{/i} (1963). To the former reasons of women discomfort, it must be added their infantilization, the gender courses at schools, their renounce to a professional career and the attribution of a mere sexual and biological function to them. She proposes formation and a paid job as their way out."

This way, one of the methods to spread the cause of the liberation movement for the women was the {i}consciousness-raising{/i}. This method, that helped to improve women's self-esteem by being recognized as a self entity, consisted in meeting together to talk about their experiences, from childhood to marriage and sexuality, aiming to prove that personal difficulties were rooted to political questions that should change; {i}the personal is also political{/i}.

This way, it denounces the colonialist effects of free trade treaties, the extractivism and the super-projects that plunder the local resources from the communities. Furthermore, it manifests the lack of political responsibility towards the severity of energy crisis and the permissibility with energy corporations' profit, and emphasizes the way agriculture, livestock and agri-food industry, all highly masculinized, impose unhealthy products and stop the development of other farming models, more healthy and with higher femenine presence. Lastly, ecofeminism is against war culture and the arms industry."

The rules of beautiness imposed by the patriarchal society tells to the women they must strive to achieve an impossible femenine ideal. They enslave themselves by their physical appearance and they keep away from having a full life and from feminist activities. So this myth economically impacts to women as individuals and capitalist society in general; historically, because it converted them in commodities, as their economical security depended upon how close they are to that ideal, and now upon their consumption of goods and services. This way, the myth opresses women in the scopes of work, culture and religion, sex and food, trapping them through cosmetics, diet, physical exercise and plastic surgery. The autor proposes a feminist future in which the value of the women would depend upon an own definition of beautiness. Women have to have multiple chioces and must be recognized as multidimensional persons, to be respected by the society as thorough and sexual people, and to have a full life. The appearances doesn't matter to feel beauty oneself."

They also demanded to not to live under the males' ideals nor their insecurities, but to be whoever they dream to be. They establish that {i}riot grrrls{/i} look for saving the psychological and cultural life of all women in the world, demanding as well the promotion and support between women and artists of all kind as a key part of the process. They settle their hate to capitalism in all its ways, and they demand to be able to validate and strengthen themselves inside the femenine community by doing, reading, watching and listening. And, last, they believe that women constitute the soul of the revolutionary force that trully can and will change the world."

She studies the everyday world as a place for power consolidation that can be questioned and shows how feminist theory is generated from the daily life and the ordinary experiences of being a feminist. Encourages to invent creative solutions, like support systems to help overcome the devastating experiences of racism and sexism, and finally mentions the confusing life to which she offers tools to live a feminist life and to strengthen the bounds between that and the feminist theory."

She states that to love is indeed a relationship of power and the inequality between men and women is the foundation of all social forms of oppression, in which it is included the nuclear family. She also demands raising children with gender neutrality and proposes the abolition of the nuclear family replacing it by egalitarian unmarried couples and collectives that raise together the children. This way, she considers that women should have more rights and freedom of speech. To sum up, she states that the origin of the oppression relies upon sexual division."

In this case women were twice discriminated: because of being women and due to the colour of their skin."
