## Pre-requisites

This game is made with [Ren'Py](https://www.renpy.org/), you can download the software from [here](https://www.renpy.org/latest.html).
Once you downloaded and installed Ren'Py, you should prepare an empty folter to contain your projects and set that as your "Projects Directory" in Ren'Py's preferences. 

Then you can download the source code for **A Violet View** into this folder.
